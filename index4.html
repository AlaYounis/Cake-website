					<li>200g/7oz almond biscuits</li>
					<li>100g toasted flaked almonds</li>
					<li>½ tsp almond extract</li>
					<li>100g butter, melted</li>
					<li>3 x 300g packs full-fat soft cheese</li>
					<li>250g caster sugar</li>
					<li>4 tbsp plain flour</li>
					<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
					<li>3 large eggs</li>
					<li>200ml tub soured cream</li>

				<ol>
					<li>
						Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line the base and sides of a 23cm springform tin with baking parchment. Bash the biscuits and 75g of the flaked almonds to crumbs – try double-bagging in food bags and crushing with a rolling pin. Mix with the almond extract and melted butter, then press into the base of the prepared tin and bake for 10 mins. Set aside to cool while you make the filling.
					</li>
					<li>
						In your largest bowl, whisk the cheese with an electric whisk until creamy. Add the sugar and whisk to combine. Whisk in the flour, then the vanilla, the eggs, one at a time, and finally the soured cream.
					</li>
					<li>
						Dollop spoonfuls of mixture into the tin, dotting in tbsps of jam as you go. Smooth the top as gently as you can.
					</li>
					<li>
						Carefully place tin on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 10 mins. Scatter with remaining almonds. Decrease oven to 110C/90C fan/gas ¼ and bake for a further 35 mins. Turn off the oven, keep the door closed and leave cheesecake to cool for 1 hr. Open oven door and leave it ajar for another hour (you can use your oven gloves to wedge it open). Cool for a third hour at room temp, then cover and chill overnight.
					</li>
					<li>
						Remove from the tin and carefully peel off the parchment. Dust with icing sugar and serve with cream.

						Heat oven to 120C/100C fan/gas and line the base of a 20cm round springform tin with greaseproof paper. Crush the biscuits in a food processor or in a food bag using a rolling pin. Tip into a bowl with the melted butter and mix well. Push the biscuits into an even layer into the base of the cake tin and chill until needed.
					</li>
					<li>
						In a separate bowl use an electric whisk to beat the soft cheese with the sugar. Next beat in the yoghurt then the eggs one at a time. Finally beat in the lemon zest, lemon juice and flour. Fold through two thirds of the raspberries crushing them very slightly so they start to bleed into the mix then tip the mix on top of the biscuit base and smooth over the top. Bake for 45 mins then turn off the oven, leave the cake inside for another hour then cool at room temperature. Chill overnight. To serve, remove from tin, scatter with remaining raspberries and dust heavily with icing sugar.

				<h2>Ingredients</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						100g butter, melted, plus a little extra for the tin
					</li>
					<li>
						200g crunchy biscuits (we used Fox's butter biscuits)
					</li>
					<li>
						600g soft cheese
					</li>
					<li>
						100g icing sugar, plus extra to taste
					</li>
					<li>
						2 tsp vanilla extract
					</li>
					<li>
						300ml pot double cream
					</li>
					<li>
						450g raspberries
					</li>
					<li>
						3 really ripe peaches, peeled if you like, or 6 canned peach halves (juice saved), diced into raspberry-sized chunks
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="Method">
				<h2>Method</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Line the base and sides of a 20cm loose-bottomed or springform tin with baking parchment – use smudges of butter to help the paper stay in place around the sides. Put the biscuits in a plastic food bag and crush to crumbs using a rolling pin, then mix thoroughly with the melted butter. Tip into the prepared tin and press down firmly to create an even base. Chill while you prepare the filling.
					</li>
					<li>
						Put the soft cheese, icing sugar and vanilla in a bowl, then beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Tip in the cream and continue beating until mixture is combined. Scatter over 100g of the raspberries and half of the peach chunks. Using a spatula, fold in with just a few folds – as you assemble the cheesecake they’ll ripple through more.
					</li>
					<li>
						Spoon the cream mixture onto the biscuit base, working from the edges inwards. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessertspoon or spatula. Leave to set in the fridge overnight.
					</li>
					<li>
						In a food processor, blitz 250g of the remaining raspberries, sieve, stir back in 1 tsp of the seeds, if you like, and sweeten to taste with icing sugar. Add enough water or canned peach juice to make it saucy and chill until serving.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bring the cheesecake to room temperature about 30 mins before serving. If using a loose-bottomed tin, unmould by placing on top of a can, then gradually pull down the sides of the tin. Slip the cheesecake onto a serving plate, removing the lining paper and base. Scatter the remaining raspberries and peach chunks over the cheesecake, dribble over some of the sauce and serve the rest alongside.
