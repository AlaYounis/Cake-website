				<h2>Ingredients</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>a little a little dairy-free sunflower spread, for greasing</li>
					<li>1 large, ripe avocado (about 150g)</li>
					<li>300g light muscovado sugar</li>
					<li>350g gluten-free plain flour</li>
					<li>50g good quality cocoa powder</li>
					<li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
					<li>2 tsp gluten-free baking powder</li>
					<li>400ml unsweetened soya milk</li>
					<li>150ml vegetable oil</li>
					<li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
					<li>85g ripe avocados flesh, mashed</li>
					<li>85g dairy-free sunflower spreads</li>
					<li>1200g dairy-free chocolate, 70% cocoa, broken into chunks</li>
					<li>25g cocoa powder</li>
					<li>125ml unsweetened soya milk</li>
					<li>200g icing sugar, sifted</li>
					<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
					<li>gluten-free and vegan sprinkles, to decorate</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Method</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Grease 2 x 20cm sandwich tins, then line the bases with baking parchment. Put the avocado and the sugar in a food processor and whizz until smooth. Add the rest of the cake ingredients to the bowl with 1/2 tsp fine salt and process again to a velvety, liquid batter. Divide between the tins and bake for 25 mins or until fully risen and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cool in the tins for 5 mins, then turn the cakes onto a rack to cool completely. While you wait, start preparing the frosting. Beat together the avocado and sunflower spread with electric beaters until creamy and smooth. Pass through a sieve and set aside.
					</li>
					<li>
						Melt the chocolate, either over a bowl of water or in the microwave, then let it cool for a few mins. Sift the cocoa into a large bowl. Bring the soya milk to a simmer, then gradually beat into the cocoa until smooth. Cool for a few mins. Tip in the avocado mix, icing sugar, melted chocolate and vanilla, and keep mixing to make a shiny, thick frosting. Use this to sandwich and top the cake. Cover with sprinkles or your own decoration, then leave to set for 10 mins before slicing. Can be made 2 days ahead.

		<h1>Chocolate & sesame loaf cake</h1>

			Tahini gives this cake a subtle nutty flavour that partners perfectly with rich chocolate. This recipe makes 2 cakes, so why not freeze one as a treat for another day!

				<h2>Method</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease two 900g loaf tins (8.5cm deep) and line with baking parchment.</li>
					<li>First, make the chocolate cake mixture. Put the butter and chocolate in a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally. Put all the other ingredients in a large mixing bowl and, when the chocolate and butter have melted, pour over and mix with an electric whisk until smooth and well combined. Set aside and rinse the beaters.</li>
					<li>In another large bowl, add all the sesame cake ingredients, then combine with an electric whisk until smooth.</li>
					<li>Alternating with dollops of each mixture, divide between the two tins. Level the top, then swirl a skewer through the mixture to create a marbled effect. Bake in the middle of the oven for 45-50 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave the cakes to cool completely on a wire rack while you make the topping (there’s enough for both cakes but the topping recipe is easily halved if you want to freeze one and ice it later)</li>
					<li>Heat the double cream and butter together gently in a small pan until just simmering, then remove from the heat and add the chocolate. Stir until the mixture is smooth, then place in the fridge for 20 mins to firm up.</li>
					<li>Beat well with a wooden spoon, then transfer to a disposable piping bag. Snip the end off to make a wide opening, then pipe thick, overlapping zigzags across the cakes. Cut the sesame snaps into shards and arrange on top, scattering over any crumbs, then serve.</li>

					<li>
						150ml rapeseed oil, plus extra for greasing
					</li>
					<li>
						250g cooked beetroot
					</li>
					<li>
						50g cocoa
					</li>

					<li>
						100g plain white flour

				<h2>Method</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Heat oven to 160C/140C/gas 3 and grease then line the base of two x 20cm sandwich tins with baking parchment. To start making the chocolate cream stir the yogurt with the cocoa and xylitol until completely blended then set aside while you make the cake. This helps to dissolve the xylitol granules.
					</li>
					<li>
						To make the cake, first blitz the beetroot in a food processor until it resembles a thick puree. Tip in the cocoa, flours, ground almonds, xylitol, baking powder and soda and pulse briefly to mix the ingredients together.
					</li>
					<li>
						Now add the eggs, the 150ml rapeseed oil, vanilla extract and milk, and blitz again to make a smooth liquid batter.
					</li>
					<li>
						Divide the mixture evenly between the tins working quickly, as the baking powder activates once in contact with the liquid ingredients, then bake for 25-30 mins until a skewer poked into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Cool for few mins then remove from the tins and finish cooling on a wire rack. Once cold, carefully strip off the lining paper.
					</li>
					<li>
						To finish the chocolate cream, whip the double cream until it holds its shape. Stir the cocoa mixture then fold in all but 2 tsp. Spread a third on top of one of the cold sponge cakes, top with the remaining sponge and spread with the rest of the chocolate cream to create a swirly finish. Dot over the reserved cocoa mixture and gently feather in with the end of a teaspoon. The cake will keep in the fridge for a couple of days, but return to room temperature before eating for the best taste and texture.
